## PROBLEM STATEMENT
A table displaying the KPI achievements for all sales reps for February 2023, providing insights into the team's performance for the month.

Four files in the Excel CSV format containing all required data about the FMCG Sales Team were given.

  (a) User Master;

  (b) Retailer Master;
  
  (c) Activities Report;
  
  (d) Sales Report

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load and Read Dataset into Google colab (dataset is a csv file).
           
           Since am using Python for my Data Analysis, google colab or jupyter notebook are my favorite by default, while analyzing my dataset.
  
- Step 2 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Step 3 : Ensure consistent naming through FEATURE ENGINEERING and DATA CLEANING.
- Step 4 : Filter activities and sales data for February 2023
- Step 5 : Calculating for the Mandatory KPIs

  (a) Active Days

  (b) Retailer Universe, Coverage & Effective Coverage
  
  (c) Calls and Productive Calls
  
  (d) Sales metrics
  

## Calculating the percentages, the following expression were written;
       
        Calculate percentages for the KPI Summary Parameters 
        
        
                 kpi_summary['Coverage %'] = kpi_summary['Coverage'] / kpi_summary['Retailer Universe'] * 100
                 kpi_summary['Effective Coverage %'] = kpi_summary['Effective Coverage'] / kpi_summary['Retailer Universe'] * 100
                 kpi_summary['Productive Calls %'] = kpi_summary['Productive Calls'] / kpi_summary['Total Calls'] * 100
                 kpi_summary['Sales Value %'] = kpi_summary['Sales Actual (Value)'] / kpi_summary['Sales Target Value'] * 100
                 kpi_summary['Sales Volume %'] = kpi_summary['Sales Actual (Volume in Cartons)'] / kpi_summary['Sales Target Volume Cartons'] * 100
            


        
- Step 6 : Merge all KPIs into a Summary-KPI-Table
- Step 7 : Visualizing the KPI achievements. A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
